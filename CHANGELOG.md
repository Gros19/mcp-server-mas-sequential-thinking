## [Unreleased]

### Added
- LearningMachine-backed agent learning with culture updates and reasoning tools for synthesis agents
- Event-driven token usage tracking from model request events

### Changed
- Upgraded Agno dependency to >=2.4.7
- **BREAKING**: Routing simplified to mandatory `full_exploration` (legacy single/double/triple strategy modes removed)
- Workflow now runs complexity analysis + full sequence only (condition-based simple/full branching removed)
- Forced strategy validation now rejects legacy strategy keys and accepts only `full_exploration`
- `sequentialthinking` tool contract now documents multi-step loop orchestration in tool description and input schema metadata
- `sequentialthinking` now publishes `outputSchema` and returns `structuredContent` control fields (`should_continue`, `next_thought_number`, `stop_reason`, and parameter guidance)
- Tool description and usage guidance now explicitly require active reflection (`isRevision=true` when correcting prior steps)
